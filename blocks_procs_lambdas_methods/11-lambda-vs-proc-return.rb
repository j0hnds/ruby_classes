# Procs in Ruby are drop in code snippets, not methods. Because of this, 
# the Proc return is the proc_return methodâ€™s return, and acts accordingly. 
# Lambdas however act just like methods, as they check the number of 
# arguments and do not override the calling methods return. For this reason,
# it is best to think of lambdas as another way to write methods, an anonymous 
# way at that.
